API Must...
Fetch all games, with average rating
Fetch one game, with all reviews
Create a review

W11D2
Demo the front end (show what we're aiming for)
Set up starter (start from scratch using steps above)
Create sequelize tables
    - games
    - platforms
Insert data (use pre-built data arrays)
Set up End points time permitting ?

W11D3
Set up end points (if not done before)
Have join table/ seeder set up prior to EOD
    - reviews
    - gamePlatforms join table
Add relationships to models
Add queries to end points to 2 fetches (get all games, get a game by id) /create appropriate data
Format and send response to front end via res.render

W11D4
Add model validation for Review
    len validator set to 6 is allowing reviews of 5 characters but not 4??? I dunno wtf that is.
Add server validation for creating a Review (no need to introduce express-validator here I think)
Lazy load aggregate data (ratings for fetch-all route)

Demo end points needed
GET /games
    D3 - Fetch all games and their platforms
    D4 - Lazy load average rating for each game
GET /games/:id
    D3 - Fetch one game and all of its reviews
POST /games/:id/reviews
    D3 - Take in data to create a review for given game id
    D4 - Validate incoming data
